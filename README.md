## Features

- Motion detection with customizable sensitivity settings.
- Live streaming of camera feed through a web interface.
- Option to configure motion notifications (email, mobile push notifications).
- Support for various camera models and configurations.
- Ability to store recorded footage on local, network-attached, or cloud storage.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the webcam security system, ensure you have the following:

- Raspberry Pi or compatible single-board computer.
- USB webcam or compatible camera module (e.g., Raspberry Pi Camera).
- MicroSD card (at least 8GB) for flashing the MotionEyeOS image.
- Power supply for your device.
- Access to a local network with internet connectivity.

## Installation

1. Download the latest MotionEyeOS image for your specific hardware from the [official repository](https://github.com/ccrisan/motioneyeos/releases).

2. Use [Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/) or a similar tool to write the downloaded image to the MicroSD card. Be careful, as this process will erase all data on the card.

3. Insert the MicroSD card into your device, connect the camera, and power it up.

## Configuration

1. Access the MotionEyeOS web interface by entering the device's IP address into your web browser (e.g., `http://device_ip_address:8765`).

2. Follow the setup wizard to configure your camera settings, including language, timezone, and camera hardware.

3. Enable motion detection in the camera settings and adjust sensitivity as needed.

4. Optionally, set up motion notifications using email or mobile push notifications.

5. Configure storage options to save recorded footage, including local, network-attached, or cloud storage.

## Usage

- Access the live stream from your camera through the MotionEyeOS interface.
- View recorded footage in the "Media" tab of the web interface.
- Optionally, set up port forwarding on your router to access the camera remotely. Always take security precautions when exposing your camera to the internet.
